ndcsv: N-Dimensional CSV files for xarray
=========================================

NDCSV is a file format that allows storing N-dimensional labelled arrays
into human-readable CSV files and read them back without needing any
configuration, load hints, or sidecar configuration files.

The fundamental concept is that, unlike :meth:`pandas.DataFrame.to_csv`
and :func:`pandas.read_csv`, reading and writing objects is fully automated
and reversible. One does not need to specify how many rows and/or columns of
header are available - the file format is unambiguous and the library
automatically does the right thing.

The format was designed around `xarray <http://xarray.pydata.org>`_, so it
supports, out of the box:

- Arrays with any number of dimensions
- Labelled, named indices
- Non-index coordinates
