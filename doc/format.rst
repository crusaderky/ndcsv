File format specifications
**************************

CSV settings
============
NDCSV files are a strict subset of the CSV format and can be read and written
with any CSV editor.
They must respect all default conventions of the Python :mod:`csv` module:

- Field separator is , (comma)
- Decimal separator is . (dot)
- Line separator can be either CRLF or LF
- Double quotes may be used to wrap commas and newlines in strings
- Numbers may be expressed in scientific format e.g. 1e-10
- Thousands separators are **not** supported
- Fancy Excel formatting is **not** supported

Unlike in :mod:`csv`, it is by design not possible to deviate from the above.

Dimensions representation
=========================
The NDCSV format can represent almost arbitrary N-dimensional hypercubes.
The parent CSV format, however, is restrained by the physics of computer
screens and can only represent 2-dimensional arrays. To work around the
problem, NDCSV files with more than 2 dimensions are flattened to 1 or 2
dimensions using :class:`pandas.MultiIndex`, and automatically unstacked when
they are loaded back.

This means that **the same in-memory object can have multiple equivalent
representations on disk**. For example, you can represent a 3-dimensional
array in NDCSV as:

- a 1-dimensional array with a 3-levels MultiIndex on the rows
- a 2-dimensional array with a 2-levels MultiIndex on the rows and a
  simple index on the columns
- a 2-dimensional array with a simple index on the rows and a 2-levels
  MultiIndex on the columns

Hypercubes with higher dimensionality offer exponentially more permutations
to choose from.

It is up to the user to decide which representation is the most compact and
human readable. The :func:`~ndcsv.write_csv` function will automatically stack
all dimensions beyond the first on the columns; if the user wants to stack
dimensions on the rows he'll need to manually invoke
:meth:`xarray.DataArray.stack` beforehand.

0-dimensional array
-------------------
A scalar (a-dimensional array) can be represented as a flat number.
The CSV file must have exactly one cell::

  10

1-dimensional array without MultiIndex
--------------------------------------
An array with exactly one dimension must be represented as follows:

==========  ===
time
==========  ===
2017-12-31  10
2018-12-31  10
2019-12-31  100
==========  ===

The first row has exactly one cell, whereas all other rows have exactly 2 cells.

**Pandas notes**

If the index.name is null (where index.name is 'time' in the example above),
then it will be set to dim_0 by default. You cannot have unnamed dimensions in
NDCSV.

1-dimensional array with MultiIndex
-----------------------------------
Arrays with 2 or more dimensions can be flattened into a 1-dimensional array:

========  ==========  ===
currency  time
========  ==========  ===
USD       2017-12-31  10
USD       2018-12-31  10
GBP       2019-12-31  100
========  ==========  ===

The first row has exactly 1 cell less than the other rows.

**xarray notes**

The name of a MultiIndex dimension (as opposed to its levels) is irreversibly
lost when exporting to NDCSV.

2-dimensional array without MultiIndex
--------------------------------------
Arrays with exactly 2 dimensions can be represented flattened as in the above
paragraph, or in their natural form as defined below:

== == == == ==
y  y0 y1 y2 y3
x
== == == == ==
x0 1  2  3  4
x1 5  6  7  8
== == == == ==

.. note::
   The second line of header is mandatory. This may feel unnatural
   for long-time Excel or Pandas users, but it is the only way to

   1. Define the name of both dimensions (which, unlike in pandas, are
      always mandatory)
   2. Unambiguously allow the :func:`~ndcsv.read_csv` function to tell apart
      this use case from all others.

**Pandas notes**

If the index.name is null (where index.name is 'x' in the example above), then
it will be set to dim_0. If columns.name (where columns.name is 'y' in the
example above), then it will be set to dim_1. You cannot have unnamed
dimensions in NDCSV.

2-dimensional array with MultiIndex on the rows
-----------------------------------------------
Arrays with 3 or more dimensions can be represented with all but the last
dimension stacked on the rows, as defined below:

== == == ==
z     z0 z1
x  y
== == == ==
x0 y0 1  2
x0 y1 3  4
x1 y0 5  6
x1 y1 7  8
== == == ==

If there are N stacked dimensions on the rows, cells 2 to N of the first row
are blank. On row 2, cell N+2 onward are blank.

2-dimensional array with MultiIndex on the columns
--------------------------------------------------
Arrays with 3 or more dimensions can be represented with all but the last
dimension stacked on the columns, as defined below:

== == == == ==
y  y0 y0 y1 y1
z  z0 z1 z0 z1
x
== == == == ==
x0 1  2  3  4
x1 5  6  7  8
== == == == ==

If there are N stacked dimensions on the columns, then row N+1, cell 2 onward
are blank.

2-dimensional array with MultiIndex on both rows and columns
------------------------------------------------------------
Arrays with 4 or more dimensions can be represented with dimensions stacked on
both rows and columns, as defined below:

== == == == == ==
y     y0 y0 y1 y1
z     z0 z1 z0 z1
w  x
== == == == == ==
w0 x0 1  2  3  4
w0 x1 5  6  7  8
w1 x0 1  2  3  4
w1 x1 5  6  7  8
== == == == == ==

Cells 2 to N of the first row are blank; this means that the MultiIndex on the rows
has N stacked dimensions. Row M, cell N+1 is blank. This means there's M-1 stacked
dimensions on the columns.

Non-index coordinates
=====================
A non-index coordinate is an additional piece of information associated to an
index coordinate. Non-index coordinates must be represented like a MultiIndex
(above), but their label must be formatted ``coord name (dim name)``.

Example:

======= ================== ==
country currency (country)
======= ================== ==
Germany EUR                10
France  EUR                10
UK      GBP                10
======= ================== ==

There must be a strict 1:N cardinality between a non-index coordinate and its
index coordinate. The following is **invalid**:

=== ========== ==
uid name (uid)
=== ========== ==
1   John Doe   10
1   John Smith 20
=== ========== ==

If you need N:N cardinality, you should use a plain MultiIndex (or write the
data in 2-dimensional format), both of which allow for the cartesian product
of all values.

Dimensions without coordinates
==============================
A dimension may not have an explicit coordinate as long as the dimension
name can be inferred from non-index coordinates. In this case, the index
coordinate defaults to an incremental counter 0, 1, 2...

========== ========= ==
name (uid) age (uid)
========== ========= ==
John Doe   18        10
John Smith 25        20
========== ========= ==

Duplicate indices
=================
Indices may be duplicated; however only unique indices can be unstacked
automatically.

Data types
==========
NDCSV inherits all automatic dtype recognition from :func:`pandas.read_csv`.
This includes automatic recognition of NaN values.

Unlike in :func:`pandas.read_csv`, the default settings cannot be changed
by design, for the sake of reproducibility.

It is impossible to go beyond automated type recognition based on the text
representation of the data itself; e.g. there is no way to force an integer
to be int32 instead of int64.

NDCSV implements additional treatment on top of :func:`pandas.read_csv`:

- Any coord where all elements are T, F, Y, N, TRUE, FALSE, YES, NO (case
  insensitive) is converted to boolean
- Any non-numeric coord where all elements can be parsed with
  :func:`pandas.to_datetime` is converted to datetime64. NDCSV prefers
  European convention DD/MM/YYYY to the American convention MM/DD/YYYY.
  Note that this is unlike the default settings of :func:`pandas.to_datetime`,
  which instead prefer the American format.
  It is strongly recommended to use ISO dates YYYY-MM-DD to prevent confusion.

Numerical IDs
-------------
Just like in :func:`pandas.read_csv`, numerical IDs starting with 0 are not
converted to integers (and therefore lose the 0) as long as there's at least
one other non-numerical ID in the same coordinate.

Empty cells and NaNs
--------------------
Empty cells, as per pandas default behaviour, are treated as NaN.
It is not possible to have empty cells or NaNs in any of the coordinates, as
that would create ambiguity when reading back the files from disk.
